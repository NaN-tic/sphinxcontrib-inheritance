- Allow adding items in bullet lists as if the items were in the original list.
  Currently it is only possible to add a new bullet list which adds a space 
  between the existing and the new one (by doing :after:*:bulletlist:) or add a 
  subitem of a existing item in the list (by doing :after:*:list_item).
- Allow adding entries in a toctree directive as if the entries where in the
  original declaration.
- Fix (or extend) the toctree directive to support inheritance. Provably it
  could be done regenerating inline toctree after apply inheritance.
